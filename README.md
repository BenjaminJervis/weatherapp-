# Project Title 
Make a simple weather app that gives current weather data and a five day forecast 

# Description
For this task we had to create a weather app with form inputs
that would let people who are traveling search for a city to find out weather information for the city they are in. When the user enters their chosen city they are presented with the current weather conditions for that city. This includes the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
The weather app will also present future weather conditions for that city in terms of a five day forecast. The five day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. 
Finally if the user reopens the weather dashboard they are presented with the last searched city forecast.
